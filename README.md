## FAQ
**- I am seeing `\u*` before my outputs(for example in price)**
*This is a unicode symbol. For example: `\u00a3` is a UK pound sign, so `\u00a3250.00` would be `Â£250` if you encoded the unicode character.*

**- The URL output from `searchresults.py` is not a full URL**
*Add `https://www.amazon.co.uk` in front of it. (Or whatever amazon region you want to scrape, this example goes to .co.**uk**)*
